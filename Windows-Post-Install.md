This is a simple Windows update blocker, in my opinion i would not recommend using it because of no update monitoring.

Installing Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA drivers through Windows Update can be unreliable and may lead to system instability. For optimal performance and stability, it's recommended to download and install the latest drivers directly from the manufacturer's website.

Below is driver assistant tools for Intel / AMD / NVIDIA.

* 🖥 ***AMD***: [Download Center](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html)

* 🖥 ***NVDIA***: [Download Center](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)

The most stable version can vary depending on the specific system. It's recommended to research and find the optimal version for your particular hardware and software configuration.
